## Consultative prompt using the "Ask the Expert" technique

**“Ask the Expert” Approach:** Before starting a complex task, ask the AI to analyze the project and request clarification questions before proposing a solution.

```markdown
Analyze the project and ask me any questions you consider necessary to clarify the goal before proposing a solution.
```

After receiving your exhaustive answers, the AI proposes a comprehensive and refined plan that is much closer to a final solution. 

This consultative style helps uncover blind spots in authentication, scalability, or privacy requirements before coding begins.
